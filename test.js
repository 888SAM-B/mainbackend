    "title": "Control Flow",
    "content": `Control flow statements allow you to control the execution order of your code.
    The "if" statement executes a block of code if a condition is true.
    The "elif" statement provides an alternative condition, and "else" handles the case where all conditions are false.
    For example, "if x > 10" will execute the code if x is greater than 10, and "else" can handle the case if it is not.
    Python also includes "while" loops for repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    "For" loops iterate over a sequence, such as a list or a range of numbers.
    You can control the flow of a loop with "break" (to exit the loop) and "continue" (to skip to the next iteration).
    Logical operators like "and", "or", and "not" can combine multiple conditions in control flow statements.
    Control flow is essential for making decisions and managing the flow of execution in Python programs.
    Learning how to use control flow allows you to create dynamic and flexible programs.`
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "module": "Core Python Concepts",
    "title": "Loops",
    "content": `Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
    "For" loops are commonly used when you know the number of iterations in advance.
    A "for" loop in Python iterates over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or range of numbers.
    Example: "for i in range(5)" will iterate through the numbers 0 to 4.
    "While" loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.
    Example: "while x < 10" will continue looping as long as x is less than 10.
    Loop control statements, like "break" and "continue", allow you to modify the flow of the loop.
    "Break" exits the loop immediately, while "continue" skips to the next iteration of the loop.
    Nested loops can also be used, where a loop is inside another loop, but be mindful of performance.
    Mastering loops is important for performing repetitive tasks efficiently in Python.`
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "module": "Core Python Concepts",
    "title": "Functions",

                Closures allow functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created.
                They are commonly used to create private variables and functions.
                Closures enable data encapsulation, which helps in creating secure applications.
                Understanding closures is essential for functional programming in JavaScript.
                They also play a role in event handling and asynchronous operations.
                The lexical scope determines what variables are accessible within a closure.
                Closures are useful in situations like caching and memoization.
                The this keyword behaves differently in closures, so it's important to understand its context.

                In object methods, 'this' refers to the object the method is part of.
                The 'this' keyword behaves differently in arrow functions, where it takes the value from its surrounding context.
                JavaScript provides methods like call(), apply(), and bind() to explicitly set 'this'.
                Understanding how 'this' works is key to writing flexible and maintainable code.
                Arrow functions do not have their own 'this' context but inherit it from the surrounding scope.
                Use bind() to permanently bind 'this' to a specific object in any function.
                Mastering the behavior of 'this' is important for handling events and callbacks.

                The prototype is an object that acts as a blueprint for other objects.
                You can add properties and methods to an object’s prototype to share them across instances.
                Prototype inheritance allows you to create reusable objects with shared behaviors.
                Understanding the prototype chain is crucial for working with custom objects and constructors.
                The 'constructor' property on objects points to the function that created them.
                Inheritance can be used to extend or override object behaviors.
                Prototypal inheritance is a powerful feature that promotes code reuse.

                Classes are syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance.
                A class is defined using the 'class' keyword, and it can contain methods and a constructor.
                The constructor method is called when an object is created from a class.
                Inheritance can be implemented using the 'extends' keyword.
                The 'super' keyword calls the parent class’s constructor and methods.
                Classes improve code readability and organization by using a more familiar object-oriented pattern.

                A Promise is created using the 'new Promise()' constructor, passing a callback function.
                The .then() method is used to specify the action to take once the Promise is resolved.
                The .catch() method handles errors if the Promise is rejected.
                Promises allow you to write cleaner, more manageable asynchronous code.
                Promise chaining allows handling multiple asynchronous operations sequentially.
                The .finally() method is used to execute code after the Promise is resolved or rejected.

                Async/await makes asynchronous code appear synchronous, improving readability.
                The await expression always returns a resolved value or throws an error.
                Handling errors in async functions is done with try-catch blocks.
                Async/await is based on Promises, so it simplifies the handling of multiple asynchronous tasks.
                Async/await is particularly useful for writing clean code when working with APIs.
                The code execution in async functions is non-blocking, ensuring responsiveness.

                The yield keyword returns a value and pauses the function's execution at that point.
                The function can be resumed using the .next() method on the iterator.
                Generators are useful for managing state and handling asynchronous tasks like promises.
                They can be used to implement iterators, lazily load data, or create complex flows.
                Generator functions are particularly helpful for handling large data sets or streams.
                The 'return' statement in generators ends the iteration and returns a final value.

                Iterators are objects that allow you to iterate through a collection, such as an array or map.
                JavaScript provides built-in iterators for common objects, like arrays and sets.
                Symbols can be used to define custom iterators for user-defined objects.
                Iterators allow you to control how collections are traversed in loops.

                Communication between the main thread and the worker is done using the postMessage() method.
                The onmessage event listener is used to receive messages from the worker.
                Web Workers are useful for offloading heavy computations and data processing.
                Workers run in a separate global context and don’t have access to the DOM.

                Garbage collection is a process where the engine reclaims memory from objects no longer in use.
                Objects are eligible for garbage collection when there are no remaining references to them.
                The 'garbage collector' runs periodically to free up unused memory.
                Memory leaks occur when objects that are no longer needed are still referenced.
                Tools like Chrome DevTools help monitor memory usage and find leaks.

                The event loop handles the call stack and message queue, ensuring smooth execution.
                The call stack contains functions that are currently being executed.
                The message queue stores asynchronous tasks like events and promises.
                When the call stack is empty, the event loop moves tasks from the message queue to the stack.
                JavaScript uses a non-blocking, single-threaded concurrency model.
                Asynchronous operations are queued and executed in order once the stack is clear.

                We encourage you to practice your skills by building real-world projects, collaborating with others, and participating in developer communities.
                You can also look into contributing to open-source projects to gain experience and network with other developers.
                Don’t forget to keep learning and exploring new JavaScript features, as the language continues to evolve with new updates and libraries.
                As a next step, consider taking advanced courses or specializing in areas like backend development with Node.js or mobile app development using JavaScript frameworks.
                Thank you for being part of this course, and best of luck on your journey to becoming a JavaScript pro!`
